------

A datanaut is a voyager exploring the Dataverse.
 
This is a documented journey of my discoveries and learnings of data and visualizations as I "chart" the Dataverse
(yes pun intended:D).  I intend to keep a travel log for future self-reference, and try my best to make the content 
readable and accessible to 
our community of datanauts.

All Artwork and images are designed by myself.  Icons are used from [Font Awesome][].

datanaut.io is powered by [Jekyll][] and [Github Pages][].
