A datanaut is a voyager exploring the Dataverse.
 
This is a documented journey of my discoveries and learnings of data and visualizations as I "chart" the Dataverse
(yes pun intended:D).

I intend to keep a travel log for future self-reference, and try my best to make the content readable and accessible to 
our community of datanauts.
