If you believe something is worth fighting for and you strongly believe in that cause, then you need to have patience and 
the humility to accept things that go against you, and stick with those beliefs and they will fundamentally pay off.

I have been working very very hard this past 2 months in preparation for a big move in my life.  I have given my best,
and will continue to do so, but for this specific event, I can only hope for the best!

Sorry I have been AFK for some time, but I will be back with a sling of projects moving forward soon.  Development on GRADE 
also needs to pick up so I think I will be extremely busy in the upcoming future.
