Today, I decided to spend some time researching more about the `markdown` format.  I have been using it for quite 
some time but realized its growing popularity in documenting `READMEs`, as well as being a very easy way to
writeup HTML-like documents.

As the creator John Gruber mentioned on [Daring Fireball][]:

>   Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
>   Readability, however, is emphasized above all else.
>   A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text,
>   without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

------

## So what did I learn NOT to do?
I spent a good few hours reading and making sure that I understand the conventions that Gruber was laying out in his 
guide.  A few things that I noted in particular that I was *not* doing:

-   The key convention/style is to make sure that you are writing a document that is readable by itself!  This means
    to avoid the use of too much HTML tags whenever necessary and keep the document reading like a written "English" 
    article.
    
-   It's good to use *hanging indents* when making lists, instead of the lazy way i.e. try to indent immediately 
    after the list icon, and align subsequent lines with indents when necessary.  It is both aesthetically pleasing 
    and avoids potential errors due to mis-indentation or missing line breaks.
    
    ```
    # Do this
    *   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
        Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
        viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
    *   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
        Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
      
    # and not this
    *   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
    *   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
    ````

-   The use of link references e.g. `[link][link:id]` and specifying anywhere in the document `[link:id]: 
    link_address` is a great way to organize the markdown document.  It creates a more readable flow and delegates 
    links as "footnotes" which can also be reused throughout the website.  This approach also works with images. 
    There are also some shortcuts that we can employ:
    -   `[link][]` is a shorthand for setting `link:id` to the name `link` itself
    -   `<www.example.com>` is a shorthand for setting `www.example.com` as both the text to be displayed and the link 
        object.

## Github vs Jekyll Markdown flavors to use?
This [stackoverflow post] helped me answer a lot of the question I had about the defaults that Jekyll and Github 
Flavored Markup (GFM) are using.

A brief summary:
-   Jekyll retired `Maruku` in favor of `kramdown` as the default parser.

-   GFM is parsed using `redcarpet2`.

-   If you are using `kramdown`, backtick codefences that are commonly used in Github markdown documents will not 
    work.  You have to use codefences utilizing tildes `~~~` instead.

-   Jekyll has support for `redcarpet` but not `redcarpet2`, which needs to be installed through a ruby `gem`, but
    using `redcarpet` is sufficient for most features that you see in GFM e.g. backtick codefencing.
    
-   If you are using `kramdown`, you would need to use liquid-tags for `Pygment` syntax-highlighting.  If you are using
    `redcarpet`, you get the syntax-highlighting for free without using liquid tags (*this is somewhat weird to me 
    considering that `kramdown` is Jekyll's default parser but is lacking this nice convenient option to ignore 
    liquid tags for syntax-highlighting*).

Based on these learnings, and identifying my preferred use of markdown and reusable workflow with Github markdown 
documents, my recommendation choice was to use `redcarpet` as the markdown parser for Jekyll.  This allows me to keep
the backtick codefences and still get the full syntax-highlighting without the need to adjust the codefences or to 
use liquid-tags for highlighting.

Hopefully Jekyll team is able to add an option for `GFM` in its entirety, this will allow many Github documents to be
reused without adjustments to the markdown documents.

------

Anyway, in summary, these are the things that I have learned today, and I am applying these conventions/practices 
immediately to get more familiar, and to practice and practice until this sinks in as a natural muscle memory
in quickly typing and organizing markdown documents! :)
