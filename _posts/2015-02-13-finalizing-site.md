## Styles and Images
I've made some huge styling updates to the site, and spent a night drawing some simple ink-drawings that I'm using 
throughout the site.  I will probably be adding more images and background-borders in the future.


## TODOs
As of today's writing, I wrote a TODOs list for what's remaining on the site:

- [x] Finalize Styles
- [x] Draw ink images
- [x] Update resume
- [x] Set up blog sections by categories
- [x] Set up blog tags
- [] Set up pagination for blogs/collections (*waiting for this to be incorporated into Jeklly collections*)
- [] Create Project sections by Language
- [] Create Art section
- [] Create People/Influence section
- [] Create Updates/Site in `index.html` (bring in blog and project updates).

[Jekyll][] currently lacks some flexibility in `paginators`.  It is currently not possible, without the use of a plugin
to paginate collections or subsets of posts in multiple pages.  I think there's some development going on Github on 
expanding their `paginators`.

## What's next
I have spent the last 5 weeks really digging into Jekyll and working on the skeleton of the site.  The main backbone 
is now functional, so I should **FINALLY** have time again to start working on some visualizations!

Here's a very inspirational collection of projects and visualizations by [Carlo Zapponi][].  The [bolides][] 
visualization of meteorites is fascinating, and is something I'll definitely work on in the future on some similar 
ideas e.g. disease incidence and death rates.
 
Until then, signing off!
