## [Interactive Project Link][]

This is a data analysis writeup (as of 02/09/14) for the R [Shiny][] application - **Power to Choose (PTC)**, built to
visualize *up-to-date* electricity plans and prices in the [ERCOT][] utility market.

The project is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance and all code and implementation is open-source and made available on 
[Github][github].

## Summary

### What is PTC
[Power to Choose][] (PTC) is a consumer choice website set up by the [PUC][] to provide customers a competitive platform to
compare electricity plans and offers in Texas.

The native presentation of the data is in the form of an interactive table with search/filter widgets.

![image-native]

### How to use PTC
The general use of PTC is to quickly compare estimated prices at monthly usage thresholds (`500kWh`, `1000kWh`, `2000kWh`). 
The various Electricity Facts Label (EFL) price values corresponds to these usage thresholds.

From the main interface shown above, a user can gather information about companies, plans and pricing details.  They can use
the filter widgets on the left to filter data they want to see (e.g. specifying a price range or contract length range).

### What is lacking on PTC
The native PTC app is great for consumers to compare prices, but it is unable to display the information completely in one
visualization i.e. the data is paginated and makes it difficult to ask questions on specific ranges and subsets.

The design of this application is to help empower *both consumers and analysts* with complete visualization of the
data/market, through the use of histograms and scatterplots that are interactively updated based on user inputs.

For instance, all the data on PTC can be visualized concisely as a scatterplot sorted by price and REP rank.

![image-scatterplot]

And with the help on the filters widgets on the left,

![image-widgets]

We can get real-time updates and full control of the dataset we wish to study.  These widgets provide useful customization of
the visualizations, some of which are listed below:

-   **Changing the dataset** e.g. changing TDU company or usage values
-   **Subsetting the data** e.g. selecting checkboxes
-   **Highlighting data records** e.g. highlighting REPs

The writeup will go into detailed analysis on some of the more interesting findings in the visualization sections.  An
in-depth overview on data gathering, cleaning, and transformation of the original datasets will be outlined in 
the [Data](#data) section.

At any time, feel free to experiment and draw your own conclusions with the interactive web application and refer to
the `.R` files found on the [Github][] project site if you need details on code implementation.

## Personal thoughts
>   With great marketing power and choices, comes great responsibility.  Unfortunately, "cheap" prices may not always be the
>   best deals on PTC.

Note that the existence of 3 usage-level pricing (`500kWh`, `1000kWh`, `2000kWh`) is one of the main drivers for the
diversity of products that can be designed and created in the Texas electricity market.

For instance, a retail electric provider (REP) can offer a product which incurs additional charges if usage is below 800kWh.
This causes the `500kWh` price to look unfavorable but the `1000kWh` and `2000kWh` prices to look much more favorable, which
would help cater to customers who are shopping at higher usage price points.

However, this is also misinformation to an average customer who does not spend time using the filter/sorting widgets on the
site (since the default sorting on PTC is at `1000kWh`).  Many companies have, and are still abusing this fact to create
attractive but misleading prices.

>   My hope is that this walkthrough and application will help the general user be more informed about the choices they make.

## PTC Rankings

### Cheap providers
In the `Rankings` tab of the application, there is a scatterplot that effectively displays the price spread by REP.  The
scatterplot is sorted by REP in descending price, so the cheapest provider will always be displayed on the *top-left* section
of the map.

By selecting a specified usage value, and highlighting a few retail electric providers (REP) of interest, we can get a quick
view on the prices in the selected market.

![image-scatterplot]

### Conclusion about REPs
This plot gives a quick indication on the price spread in the market and a sense on the "potential roles" of various REP in
the market.  We identify some interesting clusters:

![image-scatterplot-comments]

-   **Cheap**: Only a few REPs are low-price providers.
-   **Market median**: Most REPS are clustered around the market-consolidated median price.
-   **Spammer**: REPs that offer many plans are what I call *"PTC-spammers"*.  This could be a viable technique to
    overpopulate their plans more frequently across the site for a chance of customers enrolling by accident.

In addition to deriving information from the scatterplot, I have created a short `Summary` section that provides useful
statistics on the selected dataset/market (e.g. `Best`, `Top 10`, `Top 30`, `Mean`, `Top 10 REPS`).

![image-summary]

### Cheap is subjective
Just as we mentioned earlier that REPs are able to create products that look seemingly cheap at a specified EFL usage
(usually at `1000kWh` which is the default price sorting at PTC), we need to be careful on the price ranks of these
companies, and make sure that the market that we carved out using the widget selections and filtering is indeed the subset of
electricity plans we are interested in looking at.

For example, with a **default** PTC selection viewing all plans at **`1000kWh`**, the cheapest providers are `SPARK`,
`CIRRO`, `GEXA`, `STARTEX` (see below).

![image-scatterplot]

However, selecting criteria for **100% renewable energy** and a **usage level of `2000kWh`** leads to a different ranking of
cheapest providers, which are now listed as `BREEZE`, `GREEN MOUNTAIN`, `4CHANGE` (see below)

![image-scatterplot-renewable]

>   Author's note: Make sure that price is not the only criteria you are shopping with!

## PTC Market

### Aggregating the data
Our previous scatterplot information can be aggregated into price buckets to get a more natural feel for the market (if we
are not concerned with details of individual companies).  Here's the same results, as displayed in the `Market` tab of the
application, when we choose to use a histogram instead of a scatterplot.

![image-histogram]

### Adjusting Binwidths
By simply adjusting the binwidth with the widget, we can reallocate the data in the histogram to a wider binwidth.  The
following histogram shows the same data plotted with a price binwidth of 1.0c/kWh as opposed to 0.2c/kWh used in the previous
histogram.

![image-histogram-large-bin]

This wraps up the data visualization sections of the web application.  These interactive and dynamic visualizations are made
possible by `ggvis`, which is a new library being developed by Hadley Wickham.  `ggvis` is a relatively new library, so a lot
of the methods and visualizations are limited in use, and are somewhat difficult to generate at a higher customized level.
At this point, I would recommend using `ggplot2` over `ggvis`, but this application was an experiment in trying out the new
visualization library that Hadley is working on :)

## Data
>   This section provides details on the data source and processes that go towards scraping and munging the initial 
>   unorganized data into a consolidated R dataframe that is used in the Shiny app.  We will make references to the 
>   files on the [Github][github] project.

All data is owned by the [Power to Choose][] made available by the [PUC][].  I am not affiliated with the PUC, and this
writeup and application is purely for practicing and sharing thoughts behind data management and visualization.

If you are not interested in the data background and processes, feel free to jump back to the visualization sections!

### Data Source
The PTC data is conveniently provided as a organized csv download file accessed from
<http://www.powertochoose.org/en-us/Plan/ExportToCsv>

For the remainder of the data walkthrough, we will work with files in the [Github][] repository.

But first, let's scrape the data!

### Data Scraping
Open the `/data/data.R` file and let's build a quick function for pulling the data from the URL:

```R
# get_df helper function
get_df <- function() {
    # Get raw dataframe
    #
    # @return: raw dataframe returned by read.csv from provided url.
    
    url <- "http://www.powertochoose.org/en-us/Plan/ExportToCsv"
    df <- read.csv(file=url, header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
    df <- clean(df)
}
```

We can now call and store the results of `get_df` into a dataframe by:

```R
df = get_df()
```

At this point, the data that we read in has native column headers and wrong data types (most of them are converted to
`string` when we used the `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` to avoid conversions to the "difficult-to-deal-with" `factors` object type
in R).

We now tidy the dataframe `df` using Hadley Wickham's awesome [dplyr][] library for very clean execution of R data
manipulations written in concise and readable syntax.

>   The rest of the data section assumes elementary knowledge of dplyr. We assume familiarity with methods such as: `%>%`,
>   `mutate`, `select`, `arrange`, `rename`. Please check out the official `dplyr` [official guide][dplyr] if you need
>   additional resources.

### Data Munging
We will abstract most of the cleaning logic in the function `clean`

The implementation for `clean` is provided below and we'll expalin the major workflow below:

```R
# clean helper function
clean <- function(df) {
    # Clean raw dataframe
    # Rename dataframe columns and define types.  Keep some columns
    #
    # @df: raw dataframe from raw_df()
    # @return: cleaned dataframe with some columns kept
    
    columns <- c("ID", "TDU", "REP", "PRODUCT",
                 "KWH500", "KWH1000", "KWH2000",
                 "FEES", "PREPAID", "TOU",
                 "FIXED", "RATE_TYPE", "RENEWABLE",
                 "TERM_LENGTH", "CANCEL_FEE", "WEdBSITE",
                 "TERMS", "TERMS_URL", "PROMOTION", "PROMOTION_DESCRIPTION",
                 "EFL_URL", "ENROLL_URL", "PREPAID_URL", "ENROLL_PHONE")
    colnames(df) <- columns  # rename columns
    
    df <- df %>%  # mutate df using the amazing dplyr
        select(ID, TDU, REP, PRODUCT,
               KWH500, KWH1000, KWH2000,
               RATE_TYPE, TERM_LENGTH, RENEWABLE,
               PREPAID, TOU, PROMOTION, EFL_URL) %>%
        mutate(KWH500 = KWH500 * 100,  # convert units from $/kWh to c/kWh
               KWH1000 = KWH1000 * 100,
               KWH2000 = KWH2000 * 100,
               PREPAID = as.logical(PREPAID),
               TOU = as.logical(TOU),
               PROMOTION = as.logical(PROMOTION))
    
    df <- na.omit(df)  # Remove NA records
    return(df)
}
```

-   Create a vector `columns` to be used to rename the native column headers in `df`.
-   Use `dplyr`'s `select` to project only the required columns (similar to `SQL select`).
-   Change and calculate existing columns to new calculated values using `mutate`
    -   Convert pricing units from $/kWh to c/kWh
    -   Convert `PREPAID`, `TOU`, `PREPAID` columns to `logical` datatypes
-   Remove all rows with `NA` values using `na.omit(df)`

Our dataframe `df` is now nicely organized with well-named headers, and we can now load this into our `shiny` application
through `global.R` (calling it once).  In `server.R`, there are a lot more dataframe manipulations used to generate unique
visualizations, but the basis for these manipulations depend on the dataframe that we have organized cleanly in this step.

For a sneak peek, our cleaned `df` now looks like this:

![image-datatable]

And that's all to the data lifecycle section of the guide!
