Just put some finishing touches on the design of the site.  I was inspired by the color themes on <http://git-scm.com/>

The [Home][], [About][] and [Resume][] sections are now up.

------

## Projects section
I intend to try to hook up my projects this week (probably will utilize iframes calling from Gists and Github, or 
explore some Jekyll options to integrate open-source projects into the home page.

------

## Blog section
I have some ideas on designing the [Blog][] section:
-   Lay out categories and tags in an `<aside>` where we can filter blog posts by categories or tags.
-   Figure out what the categories are going to be.  Some rough categories would be: `data`, `visualization`, `site`,
   `Python`, `R`, to help users find interesting posts.
-   Explore hooking up a third-party chat/comment system, probably [Disqus]?

## A note on markdown
And I'm starting to fall in love with markdown.  I think there's already been a rising adoption of using markdowns in
many forums and chatting functionality.  Here's hoping that this awesome **writing** language for the web continues a
positive adoption trend!
