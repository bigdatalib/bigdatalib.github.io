I've been spending the last 2-3 days building this site, and adding in Twitter
Bootstrap elements where needed.

The use of [Jekyll collections][] to organize the site modules has been very
helpful.  A few things that I'm thinking of doing is to understand how blog
tags / hashtags work.

As soon as I'm done building the basic layout of the site and site modules, 
I'll be adding contents.  Roughly the site will be organized with the
following modules:

-   Homepage / News updates
-   About
-   Contact
-   Visualization panels/thumbnails
-   Blogs
-   External Links/Resources
-   Resume
