Here comes a big blog post after a period of absence on the site...

## A New Age

Today, April 3rd 2015 is my last day at **Reliant Energy** and I will be moving onto my next professional career as a **Data
Engineer at Facebook**!

I have always wanted to break into Tech over the past two years.  I have self-taught myself Python, Javascript, Web Dev, R,
and many other frameworks/libraries to empower myself with better tools to do greater things.

I think the important thing that I realized at the end of this milestone in life was that I really was not aiming to be
`*insert title*` at `*insert company*` earning `*insert salary*`.  I learned what I had to because I really was interested
and wanted to be good at what I do.

Just thinking on that for a second and realizing this is the most important thing to focus in life and keep true to it at
every point in your life.

> Focus on doing the things you love doing



## Be Grateful

As much as I ended up feeling the remorseful slow drain of Reliant's snail-paced work, I am very very grateful for spending
my time at Reliant.  Had I been stuck with a busier schedule, or had bosses who were more demanding on specific work tasks
instead of encouraging creativity exploration of solutions, I would probably never had the chance to pick up the skills that
I've learned over the past 2-3 years.

This is the letter that I wrote to my company and coworkers as I head out of my 5-year stay with Reliant Energy.  I am very
grateful for the people I worked with, and the time I spent there.



## Farewell Letter

Today is my last day at Reliant and I just want to type down a few train of thoughts that form the bulk of my Reliant
experience.

Reliant accounts a healthy 5 years of my 9-year stay in Houston (4 of which are spent at Rice University).  Over these years,
I have developed a core set of principles that I will live and carry forward in life.  I wanted to recap these and share with
the people that I have worked with to be thankful and hopefully inspire others who can identify similar experiences.

### Servant Leadership
-   I have identified many occasions at Reliant where “servants lead and leaders serve”.
-   My bosses (**Yanjing**, **Charles**, **Bill** and **Phil**) have served and sacrificed a lot to help me create an open
and creative playground to build and tinker new ideas.
-   **Project Change Team** and my bosses have provided me with the opportunities to lead and serve.

### Diversity
-   I have seen people who passionately breathe and live Reliant, and others who are objectively angry at inefficiencies at
Reliant (all in the goodwill and passion to improve the company).
-   I have learned to develop a balanced acumen for technical and business perspectives.  Much of this is attributed to
**Yanjing**, without whom, I might have walked a path of pure technical development, and missed out on the importance of
keeping business in perspective.

### Family
-   **Jack Xiong** and many others have reminded me that Reliant is about the people and close family that we work with.
-   Our recent team (**Yanjing**, **Charles**, **Shyam**, **Patra**, **Luby**, **Javier**) has been one **CRAZY + FUN**
group.  It helped pull me out of my solitary shell and I am proud to be one of the few workers to say that I have truly made
close friends within my team.

### Mentors and Mentoring
-   To my mentors **Larry**, **Diana** and **Dave** for being great sources of wisdom and advice on focusing on my passions
and building confidence in myself.
-   I have learned to be an informal mentor to others too and discovered that I actually really enjoy mentoring others as
well.  

And so ends my service at Reliant, but my services for the world and the continued relationships with all of you have just
begun!

Be fun and stay cool!

**ADVICE SECTION**
(this section is long *** WARNING WARNING *** but if you are interested in my personal advice that I learned at Reliant, read
along!)

### Follow your passions and not expectations
-   This sounds clichéd but I cannot emphasize this enough.
-   I have never cared too much about salary, rank, and destination companies.  These are good expectations to have for a
general career compass but they won’t help you be truly **happy** in life.
-   You want to build and learn things that you truly care about regardless of your career situation.  Everything you learn
as a result of your passion can help you in life whether the skills can or cannot be applied at work.

### Bet on YOURSELF
-    Do not try to be someone else, not even your inspirational heroes in life.  Otherwise you will grow into something
(maybe a monster!) that isn’t you.
-   Understand what you really want and care about and build yourself based on those passions.
-   Everything in life is unstable, the only stable thing you can trust and bet is on yourself.  So if you have personal
doubts on your abilities, do something positive about it instead of moping over the things you cannot do.  If you don’t take
action and trust yourself, you can’t really expect to trust the people and things that are **NOT** you.

### Move Fast
-   You can earn more or less money, make more or less friends in life, but you cannot gain more or less time!
-    Moving fast does not imply recklessness.  Building skills over a period of 5 years in anticipation of future events is
an example of moving fast.
-   You want to anticipate problems, and start engineering solutions so that you have more control and confidence over the
situation before you are overwhelmed and can only approach the situation by neglecting or bandaging it.

### The journey is only 1% complete
-   This is the **most** important philosophy I live with.  We are fools if we think we have accomplished 90% in work or
life.
-    Complacency sets in and we aim lower for improvements.
-   Knowing that there is **always** room for improvement and that your current set of skills/technologies/processes are
obsolete in a few years is really intimidating but provides a humble evaluation on how you can better improve yourself
constantly.

### Build not Maintain
-   Human beings are pioneers and builders.
-   If you own something, know it completely instead of maintaining someone else’s work.  You will get no joy in maintaining
another person’s work if you don’t understand it well.
-   Do not be afraid to build new things that may break current processes.  The truth is that your willingness to build and
break things speaks more about you as a responsible individual willing to take risks and improve yourself and the company.
