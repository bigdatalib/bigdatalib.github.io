## Web Applications
### [bl.ocks.org][]
Collection of webapps and visualizations built mostly with D3.js and AngularJS, with a focus on code organization and
visualization of generic datasets.

### [Datanaut][]
This is my data homepage/blog where I organize all my projects, ideas, thoughts and opinions on my passionate 
journey through data science and visualizations.  The site is statically generated with Jekyll.

## IPython
### [Project Euler Solutions][euler-nbviewer]
These are solutions written for math/algorithmic problems found on <https://projecteuler.net/>.  The solutions are 
organized in a functional and executable IPython package.  My goal is to solve all the problems when I have free time, 
but the problems seem to be getting a lot harder!  Project solutions are made available on [Github][euler-github].
