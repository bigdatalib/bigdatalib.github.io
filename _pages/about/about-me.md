## About Me

### Dataverse In a Nutshell
>   Incoming transmission: ...

Hi! My name is Chris Zhou, and I am a young data-hungry BI analyst with a deep interest in 
data organization and visualizations.

I enjoy building tools and visualizations from scratch, and have a curious mind to constantly dig deeper to uncover 
simpler abstractions of seemingly complex problems.  I highly dislike inefficiency and repetitive wastes in designs 
and processes, and I strongly believe it is worth the effort to master efficient techniques to better my personal life
and make equivalent impacts on other people.

My preferred languages that I work with are (in order): `Python`, `Javascript`, `R`

### Tell me more...
>   We require more minerals!

Curiosity and an obsessive inner drive to finding simpler forms of complex problems has embarked me on a journey of 
"programming" [autodidactism][].  Despite graduating from Rice University with a degree in Physics and Mathematics, 
I have stumbled onto the new planets of `Programming`, `DataManagement`, and `Visualizations`.

The voyage was a rough foreign universe initially, but over a period of a few years, I have learned and loved 
all the material, frameworks, and best practices that I acquired through self-coding.

I strongly believe that a combination of interest, personal-drive, **practice** and ease-of-access to coding 
resources in today's era (thank you [Google][] and [Stackoverflow][]) are the key factors to allowing me to pick 
these skills up fast.  Just as I have received these gifts from the community, I feel much obliged to contribute 
back, and I hope this website could inspire a few aspiring datanauts to venture into the unknown and come back as 
passionate pioneers. 

Spare time is hard to come by these days.  There are too many interesting dataverses to explore and map out.  
Whenever possible, I try to make time for playing PC games (Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, some DotA), as
well as practicing ink-drawings.

I live with my wonderful fiance, whom is also a data master of sorts in her quest in researching [osteosarcoma][] 
cancer.  We share our residence with our two awesome cats, `Metal` and `Sneakers`.
