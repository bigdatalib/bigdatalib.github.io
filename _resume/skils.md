# Skills
I am highly passionate about *mastering* best practices and libraries on handling data in software/language domains that I use.  I enjoy the journey of working with data from its *origin* to a rich variety of end states (visualizations, reports, and "tidy" data)

I *love* building *reuseable* workflows, and try to uphold separation of data and calculation ([MVC]() principle) in order to build scalable modularized applications/processes.

------

## In a Nutshell
- **Languages:** R, Python, Javascript, SQL, Bash, some Hive
- **Web/UI Frameworks:** `shiny`, `AngularJS`, `D3.js`
- **Office:** Excel, Access, ETL, VBA, Oracle, IBM COGNOS
- **Concepts:** Object-oriented programming, MVC frameworks and designs, `RESTful` APIs, some functional programming
- **Technical:** AWS (EC2, S3)

## Details
This section outlines the details and history of the use of my skills.  This section also includes the areas of improvements that I am looking to master in the future.
### R
- **UI / Visualizations**
    - Experience building small- to large-scale `shiny` UI applications interfacing with external datasources ranging from structured large Oracle datasets to unstructured HTML tables.
    - Universal emphasis on *data exploration* through *interactive* UI components by filtering backend datasets dynamically.
    - Projects ([link](projects.md))
    - Guides ([link](projects.md))
- **Data / Frameworks**
    - Experienced with data scraping/wrangling of unorganized data to structured dataframes using relevant packages.
    - Prefer to work in the natural construct `dataframes` whenever possible, building processes to move data from a variety of states/formats into dataframes for post-processing.
- **Tools / Concepts**
    - `shiny`, `ggplot2`, `ggvis`, `dplyr`, `reshape2`, `tidyr`, dataframes, functional programming workflow with the `apply` family
- **Future Goals**
    - Better organization of R scripts in a project (unlike Python, R does not have a strong opinionated convention for code organization).
    - Apply R to machine learning and statistical modelling.
    - Learn `pdRB` package.

### Javascript
- **UI / Visualizations**
    - Strong knowledge of `d3.js` and ability to *customize* `d3` code and data inputs to create very specific visualizations.
    - Projects ([link]())
- **Data / Frameworks**
    - Very strong opinions on using MVC frameworks for development.
    - Highly experienced with fast data manipulation and reshaping of `json` data.
    - Confident experience with AngularJS building small apps to formal projects.
    - Projects ([link]())
- **Tools / Concepts:**
    - `json`, `d3.js`, `AngularJS`, `directives`, `MVC`, `REST APIs`, object-oriented programming
- **Future Goals**
    - Begin work on `jsonframes`([Github]()).  This is a project similar to Python `pandas` to extend the Javascript language with a more powerful data object that allows easy operations on Javascript arrays, objects, and `json`.
    - Master `d3.js`
    - Learn `node.js`

### Python
- **Data / Frameworks**
    - *Go-to language* for data wrangling before formalizing the results and projects in R or Javascript.
    - Comfortable object-oriented programming experience with Python classes in simulating business workflows and mockups.
    - Highly familiar with data scraping tools (`lxml`, `requests`, `bs4`) and data manipulation *idioms* (dictionaries, classes, comprehensions, generators) with base Python.
    - Familiar usage of `pandas`, `numpy`, `IPython` as an analysis environment.
    - Some experience building `django` webapps.
    - Projects ([link]())
- **Tools / Concepts:**
    - `lxml`, `bs4`, `IPython`, `numpy`, `pandas`, object-oriented programming
- **Future Goals**
    - Master `pandas` and learn `scikit-learn`.
    - Apply Python to machine learning and statistical modelling.

### Office
- **Excel**
    - *Guru* in designing and organizing reports, utilizing organization skills acquired in other languages to design formula-light but highly interactive and dynamic spreadsheets.
    - Focus on separation of data and formulas to ensure scalable changes made in Excel reporting.
    - Preaching `sumproduct` over the popular but horrible `vlookup` formula to teammates, and focus on designing spreadsheets similar to query executions of database ETL processes (by emphasis on isolating data and creating pivot tables/graphs to visualize and report findings).
- **Access / Oracle**
    - Day-to-day use of databases and SQL queries.
    - Built database schemas and workflows to expand on large company processes by identifying source of data originations and normalizing tables as required.
    - Interfaced with Oracle procedures and API calls to extract data programmatically through R.
- **VBA**
    - Built *custom* VBA code for spreadsheet automation abstracted into functions for *reusability* i.e. this is *NOT* macro recording :)
    - Used VBA to interface with Oracle procedures to push and pull data from Oracle databases.
    - Personally, I *highly discourage* the notion of using and writing VBA code to automate workflow.  Data can be automated in another language at the data layer instead of the "reporting" layer that most people desire to automate in Excel.

### Other
- **Git**
    - Github: [chrisrzhou](https://github.com/chrisrzhou)
- **APIs**
    - Experience building and using `RESTful` APIs.
    - Comfortable accessing data through vendor APIs returning `xml` or `json` data.
    - Worked with Github, Twitter, Yelp, Coursera APIs and intend to explore more APIs in the future.
- **AWS**
    - EC2: Running [R Shiny applications](http://ec2-54-183-164-175.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3838/) on EC2
    - S3: General file hosting for web applications on S3
