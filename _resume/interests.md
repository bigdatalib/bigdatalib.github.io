# Interests
The topics I care about, the people I look up to :)

------

## Topics
- **Crowd-sourcing**
    - True company success comes from asking the world what they want before building products, instead of building products and forcefully expect people to buy them through misguided advertisements.
- **Open Internet**
    - Only a few companies gain from a controlled internet.  Unfortunately, these are the few companies that have greater control over the internet currently.
    - The whole world gains from an open internet: socially, economically, and technologically.
- **Education:**
    - MOOCs | alternative | online | crowd-sourced review-based
    - Education is too expensive for what it is generating.  My hope is that the world starts to value degrees and credentials less, and value skillsets more.  Education should focus on training individuals to succeed in their personal strengths, rather than to compete on a paper degree that does not evaluate all students accurately.
    - Not all teachers love their jobs and are not compensated fairly for their performance.  Imagine a crowd-sourced review-based education system through [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com).  This would compensate popular and successful teachers for their contributions in academic teaching, and also promote aspiring teachers to work hard and be recognized for what they do.  *Teachers and students both benefit through better quality of educational service and content.*
- **Von Neumann Machines**
    - 3D printing + unsupervised machine learning + AI
    - We are quite far from the dream of self-replicating machines and automating automation itself, but I think it is insane that the rate of concepts and research within the past decade could actually lead up to this future.
    - Mankind maybe an inevitable pre-cursor to the machine era.  I always find it cool that mankind has empowered their weaker bodies in machines to do things beyond natural reach (e.g. fighting with a flintstone, flying a plane, driving a car, riding an elevator).  To what degree, will this evolve in the next few decades?
- **Long-term Stock Investments**
    - We want *believers and builders* who have *control* over their visions and decisions, not short-term traders who care about making individual profits in an uncontrolled and opportunistic manner.
    - How do you answer short term falling stock prices?  *"I can change and cook the numbers up for you, but does that do anything to save us in the long run?  Do you care about that more?"*
- **Art**
    - pen and ink-drawings | photography | contemporary | geometric
- **Music**
    - piano | drums | progressive metal
- **Movie themes**
    - dystopic | government oppression | war/history
- **Random**

## People
* **The Data Guys**
    > **[@Mike Bostock](https://twitter.com/mbostock):** His creativity and huge efforts in provisioning open-source technology that empowers many other data grunts to keep hacking!

    > **[@Jason Davies](https://twitter.com/jasondavies):** Example of someone who has the rare combination of all viable traits: brains + art + idea + organization.
    
    >  **[@Randal Olson](https://twitter.com/randal_olson):** His work and personal drive is inspirational and makes me think twice if I should really go back to academia and explore simulations of natural processes.
    
     >  **[@Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham):** I'm not a huge fan of R, but Hadley Wickham's great work and opinionated conventions on R's workflow and usage has made learning and utilizing R a joy.
    
* **The Big Guys**

    > **[@Bill Gates](https://twitter.com/BillGates):** Solving today's neglected problems.

    > **[@Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk):** Materializing tomorrow's impossible problems.
    
    > **[Jeff Bezos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos):** Source of wisdom on life values.  His views and values on life and decision making (e.g. "regret-minimalization") is probably a hidden gem on why people who think about their life choices end up in successful/happy situations.
    
    > **[Albert Einstein]():** His humility and deep philosophical understanding of nature speaks beyond the surface of our world, and reminds that we humans are deeply connected with what makes us human: thought, creativity and resilience.
