## Business Intelligence Analyst
### [Reliant Energy][]
*an [NRG][] company, 2010 - Present*

-   **Co-led** high impact **organizational change project** aimed to recover over **$3,000,000** annually through 
    process improvements.
    -   Designed an object-oriented API pricing engine to gather [ERCOT][] industry pricing logic.
    -   Implemented design with technical and IT teams into company systems.
    -   This API will consolidate duplicated workflows in existing and future business processes.

-   Promoted use of highly automated and  **interactive visualizations** that reduces business dependency on 
    ineffcient data collection and reporting through traditional weekly Excel reporting.
    -   Developed and deployed over five [R shiny][] interactive web applications on work servers that are used by 
        more than five business teams.
    -   Examples of open-source R shiny projects can be found in the [Projects](#projects) section.

-   **Reverse-engineered** the company's supply cost transaction data system, allowing for on-demand cost queries 
    instead of waiting on weekly IT reports, generating over **40 hours of time savings** weekly across five 
    business teams.

-   Created the calculation foundations of pricing and supply that the business operates with, fulfilling pricing for
    **over 1 million** residential customers every year.

-   Designed **"company-agnostic"** tools and workstreams using industry knowledge, ensuring that the company can 
    support the efforts of multi-brand teams and future acquisitions. One of many examples is provided here:
    -   Researched, designed and implemented a lightweight database system for tracking transmission cost updates in 
        the ERCOT power grid.
    -   The system is less than 1,000 rows deep across 5 tables, but has the capability of generating over millions 
        of combinations of transmission costs, allowing for real-time cost analysis in the industry, agnostic to 
        company and brands, as opposed to static downloads of huge datasets previously employed.

-   **Jack-of-all-"data"-trades** employing relevant tools and technologies (R, Python, VBA, Oracle) to engineer 
    creative solutions for many other process-improvement and business insight requests.
