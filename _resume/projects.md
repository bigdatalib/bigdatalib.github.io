# Projects
This is a list of open-source public projects that I have done over time.  Most of them are *data-driven* visualizations and analysis writeups.

I strongly believe that *building* projects is the best way to *mastering* learned materials.  My [ongoing self-improvement goal](https://twitter.com/chrisrzhou/status/550347591708184578) is to release a visualization or webapp every 1-2 weeks.
