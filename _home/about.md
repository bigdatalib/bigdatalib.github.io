This is a documented journey of my discoveries and learnings of data and visualizatons.
I intend to keep notes for future self-reference, and to share my
findings and creations on data and visualizations as I "chart" the Dataspace (yes pun intended :D)

This site is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chrisrzhou/chrisrzhou.github.io" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>.

## About Me

### Being shy...
I'm a young data-hungry BI analyst with a focus on data organization and visualization.
I enjoy building tools and visualizations from scratch, and I tend to over-research
on the best practices that the community employs in each industry domain.


### Tell me more...
Curiosity and an obsessive need to reduce efficiency waste has inevitably geared me towards
a path of "coding" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism" target="_blank">autodidactism</a>.  Despite 
graduating from Rice University with a degree in Physics and Mathematics, I have been mostly engaging my time with
self-learning programming languages in an effort to improve efficiency in my work and life.

I stumbled upon "data visualizations" through exposure from self-learning on the Internet.  It has been a turning point
ever since, and I am focused on learning and exploring best practices and conventionalized 
techniques to manage, transform and visualize data.  The many works of my online peers (e.g 
<a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/" target="_blank">Mike Bostock</a>) is an encouraging 
motivation to work in this realm, building and sharing beautiful artistic creations through organized code,
and impacting many other people in their insights and decision-making.

Spare time is harder to come by, but I used to, and currently try to make time for playing PC games
(Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, some DotA), as well as practicing ink-drawings.

I live with my wonderful fiance, whom is also a data master of sorts in her quest in researching
cancer (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma" target="_blank">osteosarcoma</a>), 
as well as my two awesome cats, `Metal` and `Sneakers`.
